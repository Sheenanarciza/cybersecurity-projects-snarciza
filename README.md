Projects WIP - cybersecurity projects done with AWS for free at-home

Set Up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Network Security Objective: Learn how to design and secure a network within AWS. Steps: Set up a VPC with public and private subnets. Configure security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to restrict traffic flow. Launch EC2 instances in different subnets and test their connectivity based on security group rules. Explore VPC Flow Logs to monitor traffic. Implement a VPN or Direct Connect for secure communication with your local network (if you want to practice more advanced setups). Skills learned: VPC design, network segmentation, access control, traffic monitoring.

Create a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for an EC2 Instance Objective: Protect a web application using AWS WAF and CloudFront. Steps: Launch an EC2 instance running a basic web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx). Set up AWS WAF and associate it with a CloudFront distribution in front of your EC2 instance. Configure WAF rules to protect against common web attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Test the WAF rules using malicious payloads to ensure they work as expected. Optionally, set up AWS Shield for DDoS protection if you want to explore further. Skills learned: WAF configuration, web security, CloudFront, DDoS protection.

Set Up an S3 Bucket with Encryption and Access Controls Objective: Learn how to secure AWS S3 storage. Steps: Create an S3 bucket and upload some files. Enable server-side encryption (SSE) for the bucket using AWS KMS (Key Management Service). Set up IAM policies to control access to the bucket, allowing only specific users to read or write. Implement bucket policies to restrict public access to sensitive files. Enable logging to track access to the S3 bucket and review access logs for any unauthorized access attempts. Skills learned: AWS S3 security, encryption, IAM policies, access controls, logging.

Automate Security Audits with AWS Config Objective: Use AWS Config to monitor compliance and security best practices. Steps: Set up AWS Config to monitor your AWS resources and configurations. Define and apply AWS Config Rules to ensure resources are compliant with security best practices (e.g., ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible, S3 buckets are encrypted). Review configuration history and any compliance violations in the AWS Config console. Set up SNS (Simple Notification Service) to get alerts whenever a compliance violation occurs. Skills learned: Security auditing, compliance, automation, AWS Config, alerting.

Deploy a Simple Web Application with AWS Elastic Beanstalk Objective: Deploy and secure a web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Steps: Build or deploy a simple web application (e.g., a to-do list app) using a popular framework (Flask, Node.js, Django). Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment and deploy the application. Set up SSL/TLS encryption on the application to secure communication with clients. Implement IAM roles for least privilege access to resources. Add AWS WAF and CloudWatch for security monitoring and logging. Skills learned: Web application deployment, securing communication with HTTPS, monitoring, IAM roles.

Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users Objective: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts and users. Steps: Create an IAM user and enable MFA for the account. Test accessing AWS resources with and without MFA. Set up IAM policies that require MFA for specific sensitive actions (e.g., deleting an S3 bucket). Create an MFA-enabled IAM policy to enforce MFA for your administrators. Use the AWS CLI to access AWS resources, enforcing MFA when performing certain operations. Skills learned: IAM, MFA, secure access management, policy creation.

Set Up an EC2 Instance as a Security Honeypot

Objective: Set up a honeypot to detect and analyze malicious activity. Steps: Launch an EC2 instance with vulnerable services (you can use Metasploitable or install outdated software). Use AWS CloudWatch Logs or AWS GuardDuty to monitor suspicious activity. Use AWS Security Hub to analyze findings and get alerts on suspicious behavior. Optionally, deploy Suricata or Snort on your EC2 instance to monitor traffic for potential intrusions. Study any attacks or scans that occur and learn how to mitigate them. Skills learned: Honeypot deployment, intrusion detection, monitoring, threat analysis. 14. Monitor Network Traffic with VPC Traffic Mirroring Objective: Analyze network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity. Steps: Set up VPC Traffic Mirroring to capture network traffic from an EC2 instance in your VPC. Use tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to analyze the captured traffic. Look for anomalies, such as unexpected outbound connections, port scanning attempts, or unusual traffic patterns. Optionally, use AWS GuardDuty to integrate threat detection and get alerts on any suspicious traffic. Skills learned: Network traffic analysis, traffic mirroring, anomaly detection, using AWS GuardDuty. 15. Create a Secure Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan with S3 and Glacier Objective: Securely back up critical data and test disaster recovery. Steps: Use AWS S3 to back up data and implement versioning and lifecycle policies to manage older versions of data. Set up S3 Cross-Region Replication for redundancy across different geographic locations. Implement AWS Glacier for low-cost, long-term archiving of backup data. Simulate a disaster recovery scenario by deleting data and restoring it from the backup. Skills learned: Backup strategies, data archiving, disaster recovery, S3 versioning. 16. Implement Security Monitoring with CloudTrail and CloudWatch Objective: Monitor AWS API activity and automate security alerts. Steps: Enable AWS CloudTrail to record all API calls made within your AWS environment. Use CloudWatch Logs to set up custom filters for specific actions (e.g., unauthorized API calls). Create CloudWatch Alarms to alert you when specific security-related activities occur, such as changes to IAM policies or security groups. Optionally, use AWS GuardDuty to enhance threat detection. Skills learned: CloudTrail, API logging, CloudWatch, automated security monitoring.

##################################################################################################################### Example IAM + AI Projects You Can Do for Free in AWS

Automated IAM Policy Auditor Cost: Free (using IAM, Lambda, CloudWatch) Automate the audit of IAM roles and policies by using Lambda and CloudWatch to detect and alert when an IAM policy is overly permissive. Behavioral Anomaly Detection with GuardDuty & SageMaker Cost: Free during the trial period (GuardDuty), free tier usage for SageMaker Use GuardDuty’s free trial to detect suspicious IAM activity and integrate an AI model in SageMaker to predict and alert on unusual user behavior based on IAM logs.

Phishing Detection Using AI Cost: Free (using Amazon Comprehend, Lambda, SNS) Train a simple machine learning model using Amazon Comprehend to detect phishing attempts and automatically notify users via SNS.

IAM Access Analyzer and Security Hub with AI Integration Cost: Free (IAM Access Analyzer, CloudTrail, Lambda) Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify overly permissive roles and integrate it with AI models that analyze security risks and recommend mitigation.

Incident Response Automation Using Lambda and CloudTrail Cost: Free (Lambda, CloudTrail, SNS) Set up a Lambda function that automatically triggers a response when a suspicious IAM action is detected (e.g., unauthorized access to sensitive resources) based on CloudTrail logs.

##################################################################################################################### These projects cover a wide range of core cybersecurity practices, from network design to encryption, threat detection, and incident response. Each of these projects can be done within AWS’s free tier (with some limitations depending on usage), and they’ll help you gain hands-on experience in securing cloud environments.

As you work through these projects, be sure to document your process and findings (either in a blog, GitHub repo, or personal notes), as this will not only reinforce your learning but also give you something to show to potential employers or clients.
